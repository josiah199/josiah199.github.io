* [Jquery Responsive Menu](script.js)

### The Images Used

## How does the files work?

* The [index.html](index.html) is the home page. It gives a brief welcome
 and information of the times of the services.

* The [beliefs.html](beliefs.html) gives a desciption of the core beliefs of the church.

* The [sunday-school.html](sunday-school.html) gives an overview of the Sunday School program.

* The [ministries.html](ministries.html) tells how the chuch gives its time and money, at home and abroad, to further the gospel of Jesus Christ. 
 This was a four column grid with images and an overview of what the church does.
