        <h1>From the Pastor's heart:</h1> 
        <p>When the Lord called me to Celina more than 25 years ago, he burdened my heart to start a church that teaches salvation in
          Christ and Christ alone. May we glorify Christ as we walk in truth, be teachable, and trust only in Him. He truly is our only hope.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Truth: Christ is the truth. In John 14:6, Jesus said, I am the Way, the Truth, and the Life, no man cometh unto the father but by me.”
            Christ is not only the truth, he is the fulfillment of truth</li>
          <li>Teachable: Our prayer is that each member desires to be teachable and grow closer to Christ. John the Baptist said, “I must decrease, He must increase.”
            Less of us, more of Christ. Therefore, if we are not growing, we become backslidden.
            My prayer is that we as a body of believers would always stay teachable. Paul states in Philippians 3:10, “That I may know him,
            and the power of his resurrection, and the fellowship of his sufferings, being made conformable unto his death…”  </li>
          <li>Trust: We believe our primary trust should be Jesus Christ and Him alone, not in any earthly foundation. The bible says in 
            Proverbs 3:5&6, “Trust in the Lord with all thine heart and lean not upon thine own understanding. In all thy ways acknowledge
            him and he shall direct they paths.”</li>
        </ul>
