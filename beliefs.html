         <h2>Mission Statement</h2>
          <p>
           It is our mission to serve God with humbleness, endeavoring to spread the good news to all the world. 
      It is our desire as a church is to be a beacon of light, an example of brother and sisterhood, always welcoming lost souls to see the grace of God through us. 
      It is our duty to be kind to others, to admonish one another and continually display gratitude to God for His perpetual goodness.
          </p>

            <h2>We believe:</h2>
            <ul>
              <li>The scriptures are true, authoritative and sufficient</li>
              <li>There is only one true God, Creator of Heaven and Earth, who eternally exists in three distinct persons: Father, Son and Holy Ghost</li>
              <li>All humanity, Christ excluded, is sinful by both birth and action</li>
              <li>The deserved penalty for sin is death</li>
              <li>Jesus Christ is the eternal Son of God, was born of a virgin and both fully God and fully human</li>
              <li>Jesus died as the sacrificial substitute to pay the penalty for sin</li>
              <li>Jesus Christ physically rose from the dead, ascended into heaven and will one day physically return</li>
              <li>There will be a future physical resurrection of the dead</li>
              <li>Only through faith in the person and work of Jesus Christ and repentance from sin can one be reconciled to God and experience true life and joy</li>
